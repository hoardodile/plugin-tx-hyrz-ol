 * on purpose: which view is open, "loop the action", "walk the action list"
 * and "play sound" are how this viewer behaves, not facts about one character.
 *
 * Prefs are **strings** end to end, which is why every key carries a codec:
 * without one the stored value comes back as the string `"false"`, and a
 * non-empty string is truthy — the switch would read as on forever.
