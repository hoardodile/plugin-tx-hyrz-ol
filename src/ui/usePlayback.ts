/**
 * Playhead plus the sound events a clip fires on each frame.
 *
 * The clock and the event scheduling live here, and nowhere else: the frame
 * strip, the stage and the audio panel all read the same `timeMs`, and only
 * this hook decides when an exported sound event is due. A caller that wants
 * the viewer to stay silent never passes `emit`.
 *
 * Looping is *not* owned here — the viewer persists it as a preference and can
 * override it (auto-next plays to the end, which a loop never reaches), so the
 * caller passes the value the clock should use.
