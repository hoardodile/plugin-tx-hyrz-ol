 * the origin — no fit, no scaling, nothing to round. Every frame is therefore
 * inside the tile by construction: the box is the union of all of them, so a
 * moving action gets a tile the artwork travels inside rather than a tile that
 * crops it. A small character gets a small tile and a large one a large tile,
 * which is what lets the flex layout wrap. The caller owns the clock, so every
 * tile shows the same instant.
